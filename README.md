# Country React App

A simple React App to display country information, using Vite and Tailwind CSS. This project serves as practice for working with the `fetch` API in React and demonstrates how to use asynchronous data fetching, state management, and Tailwind styling. The app displays a list of countries and allows users to filter by country name.

## Project Goals

- **Practice fetching data** from an API using `fetch` in a React environment.
- **Display information dynamically** by mapping fetched data to components.
- **Style the app** with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive UI.
- **Potential for future improvements** and feature additions.

## Technologies Used

- **React** - For building the UI and managing state.
- **Vite** - Fast, modern build tool to develop and bundle the application.
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
